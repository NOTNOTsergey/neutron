# Welcome!

*Neutron logo*\
**So, you somehow got to this page.** I really appreciate it, thank you!
# What's the purpose?
Neutron is the result of me trying to get into the low-level stuff.
This project is **not** intended to do some crazy stuff like replacing the giants like Windows, Linux and macOS. That's just not possible. However, it doesn't mean i don't have an end goal. **The end goal is to write a simple 64-bit UEFI-powered OS that can run 3rd party applications and its GUI system, while requiring as little disk space, RAM and processor resources as possible.** Oh, and also, I just want to have fun :)
# Who is involved?
* Me, Andrey Antonenko, the creator, maintainer and programmer
* Sasha Kulichkov, booted this on his PC several times; created the logo
# Where does it work?
In theory, it should work on any modern system. Here are the minimal requirements:
* CPU: x86-64 architecture
* System: UEFI class 2 or 3
* RAM: 256 MB
# Show me the screenshots!
They are in the `screens` directory
# Okay, what do I need to be aware of?
Keep in mind that the system is unstable. I am **not** responsible for **any** kind of damage.
However, please tell me if you have found a bug, especially if it's dangerous enough to do any damage. That would be very nice!
# Can I join the team?
No, I don't think so. I want to do this project entirely on my own, at least yet.
